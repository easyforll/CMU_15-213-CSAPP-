howmanybits needs tricky solution.
first ,you need to handle the negative or positive number.
Then ,tough you just need to find the highest position,the ban of control flow constrains the original solution.
	In addition ,the solution of bit by bit would break the limit of the number of operations,90.
So, the solution is binary way.Solve 16 bits and use the index variable to shift the right bits.16->8->4->2->1.
